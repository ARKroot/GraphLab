Requirement
---------------------------------------

In case you have just downloaded and unzipped your GraphLab distribution, 
here's how to proceed:

First, you need Java2 (version 1.5 or higher) installed, get it from 
  http://java.sun.com 
for your platform.

In linux, you can run GraphLab with running the run.sh script.
It should be executable. So if it is not, make it executable by
running the command:
    chmod +x run.sh
You should have setted $JAVA_HOME if your java is not in path.
In windows, you can run GraphLab with just double clicking on
graphlab-main.jar file.
